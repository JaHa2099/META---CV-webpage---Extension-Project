META - HTML and CSS in depth - Extension Project - CV webpage

Welcome to my CV webpage that extends my knowledge from my Final Assessment. The main objective of this page was to apply everything that I have learned in the past month. With that said, the second objective was the identify where I need to go back and further learn. 

I used both W3 Schools and the Coursera resources to my advantage.
